# Research: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

## Validation Methods

### ROS 2
- **Validation**: Unit and integration tests for all ROS 2 packages using `pytest`.
- **Method**: Each package will have a `test` directory with `pytest` tests that are run via `colcon test`.

### Gazebo
- **Validation**: Simulation-based tests to verify robot behavior and sensor data.
- **Method**: Gazebo worlds will be created with specific scenarios to test the robot's functionality.

### Unity
- **Validation**: High-fidelity rendering and visualization of the robot and its environment.
- **Method**: The robot model will be imported into Unity and a scene will be created to visualize the robot's movements.

### Isaac Sim
- **Validation**: Simulation-based testing of perception, navigation, and manipulation tasks.
- **Method**: Isaac Sim will be used to create realistic simulations for training and testing the robot's AI models.

### SLAM
- **Validation**: Accuracy of the map generated by the SLAM algorithm.
- **Method**: The robot will be run in a known environment and the generated map will be compared to a ground truth map.

### Jetson Deployment
- **Validation**: Real-time performance of the robot's software on the Jetson platform.
- **Method**: The robot's software will be deployed to the Jetson and its performance will be benchmarked.

### VLA
- **Validation**: Accuracy of the robot's response to natural language commands.
- **Method**: The robot will be given a series of commands and its actions will be evaluated for correctness.

## APA Citation Tracking

APA citations will be tracked using a `references.bib` file and the `natbib` package in LaTeX. In-text citations will be of the form `(Author, Year)` and a full reference list will be generated at the end of the book.

## Decisions

### Simulation vs Real Robot
- **Options**:
    - Simulation-only
    - Real robot-only
    - Simulation with sim-to-real transfer
- **Tradeoffs**:
    - Simulation-only is cheaper and safer, but may not accurately reflect the real world.
    - Real robot-only is more realistic, but is more expensive and can be dangerous.
    - Simulation with sim-to-real transfer is a good compromise, but requires expertise in both simulation and robotics.
- **Recommendation**: Simulation with sim-to-real transfer.
- **Downstream impact**: The book will need to cover topics such as domain randomization and sim-to-real transfer techniques.

### Cloud vs On-Prem
- **Options**:
    - Cloud-based simulation
    - On-premise simulation
- **Tradeoffs**:
    - Cloud-based simulation is more scalable and can be accessed from anywhere, but can be expensive.
    - On-premise simulation is cheaper, but is less scalable and can only be accessed locally.
- **Recommendation**: On-premise simulation with the option for cloud-based simulation for more intensive tasks.
- **Downstream impact**: The book will need to provide instructions for setting up both on-premise and cloud-based simulation environments.

### Isaac Sim vs Gazebo as primary digital twin
- **Options**:
    - Isaac Sim
    - Gazebo
- **Tradeoffs**:
    - Isaac Sim is a more modern and powerful simulator with better support for AI and robotics, but is a proprietary software.
    - Gazebo is an open-source simulator that is widely used in the robotics community, but is less powerful than Isaac Sim.
- **Recommendation**: Isaac Sim as the primary digital twin, with Gazebo used for some of the earlier modules.
- **Downstream impact**: The book will need to cover both Isaac Sim and Gazebo.

### Jetson deployment architecture
- **Options**:
    - All processing on the Jetson
    - Hybrid processing (some processing on the Jetson, some on a more powerful computer)
- **Tradeoffs**:
    - All processing on the Jetson is simpler, but may not be powerful enough for all tasks.
    - Hybrid processing is more powerful, but is more complex to set up.
- **Recommendation**: Hybrid processing, with the Jetson used for real-time control and a more powerful computer used for more intensive tasks such as AI model training.
- **Downstream impact**: The book will need to cover topics such as networking and distributed computing.

### Humanoid vs Quadruped proxy
- **Options**:
    - Humanoid robot
    - Quadruped robot
- **Tradeoffs**:
    - Humanoid robots are more complex to control, but are more versatile.
    - Quadruped robots are simpler to control, but are less versatile.
- **Recommendation**: Humanoid robot.
- **Downstream impact**: The book will need to cover topics such as bipedal locomotion and balancing.

### VRAM limits & scene complexity
- **Options**:
    - Limit the complexity of the simulation to fit within the VRAM of the target hardware.
    - Use a more powerful computer with more VRAM.
- **Tradeoffs**:
    - Limiting the complexity of the simulation may not be realistic.
    - Using a more powerful computer can be expensive.
- **Recommendation**: A combination of both, with the book providing guidelines for creating simulations that are both realistic and can be run on the target hardware.
- **Downstream impact**: The book will need to cover topics such as performance optimization and simulation design.
