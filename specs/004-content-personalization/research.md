# Research for Content Personalization

**Feature**: `004-content-personalization`  
**Created**: 2025-12-17
**Status**: Complete

## Summary

All initial ambiguities regarding the 'Content Personalization' feature were identified and resolved during the `/sp.clarify` phase. This involved clarifying the integration mechanism with the RAG chatbot (client-side prompt enrichment), defining `contentId` as a human-readable slug, and establishing `engagementScore` as time spent on page in seconds.

No further research tasks or unresolved clarifications remain at this stage, as the specification is deemed clear and complete for planning.

## Unresolved Clarifications / Research Topics

None. All clarifications were addressed in `specs/004-content-personalization/spec.md`.
