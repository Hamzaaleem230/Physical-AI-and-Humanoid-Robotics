# Assessment Criteria

"Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics" is designed not just for reading, but for active learning and practical skill development. Therefore, a robust set of assessment criteria is essential to gauge your understanding, proficiency, and ability to apply the concepts taught. These criteria align with the book's core principles of Accuracy, Clarity, Rigor, Reproducibility, and Consistency, as well as the Constitution's Success Criteria.

## 1. Conceptual Comprehension (Understanding)

**Purpose:** To evaluate your grasp of the theoretical underpinnings and core concepts presented in each module.

| **Plagiarism-Free Content** | All work submitted is original and properly attributed, demonstrating integrity and academic honesty.                                 | *   0% plagiarism detected by automated tools (if applicable).                                                                                                                                                                                                  *   Proper citation for all borrowed ideas, figures, or code snippets. |
| **Docusaurus Build & Deployment** | The Docusaurus site builds without errors and can be successfully deployed to GitHub Pages.                               | *   Successful local Docusaurus build (`npm run build`).                                                                                                                                                                                                      *   Successful deployment to GitHub Pages via CI/CD pipeline (`SC-004`). |
| **Robotics Concepts Correctness** | Robotics concepts (AI control, sensing, locomotion, embodiment) are academically correct and technically sound. | *   The robot's behavior in simulations and (optionally) on physical hardware is consistent with theoretical expectations.                                                                                                                                                                                           *   Accurate application of control theory, kinematics, and AI principles.                                                                                                                                                                      *   Effective handling of edge cases and robust performance. |
